## AI Wardrobe: Outfit Recommendations

This feature lets users upload wardrobe items, have them auto-tagged by AI, and request outfit combinations for a given occasion.

Key pieces:
- Upload: `POST /api/upload` (uploads to Cloudinary)
- Clothing analysis: `POST /api/analyze-clothing` (Gemini image+text prompt, stores metadata client-side and in Supabase)
- Outfit recommendations: `POST /api/wardrobe-recommendations` (Gemini text prompt using your stored wardrobe items)
- UI: `app/wardrobe/page.tsx`

Environment variables required:
- GOOGLE_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side route optional fallback for RLS/testing)
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

Database:
- Table `wardrobe_items` with RLS policies is defined in `supabase-migrations.sql`.

Usage flow:
1. Go to Wardrobe page and add items (image upload + optional details). The item is analyzed by AI and saved to Supabase.
2. Enter an occasion like ‚Äúparty‚Äù and hit ‚ÄúGet AI Outfits‚Äù.
3. The page shows 1‚Äì3 outfit combinations using your stored items with short explanations.

Notes:
- Frontend requests are rate-limited client-side for stability.
- The AI route tries `gemini-2.0-flash` and falls back to `gemini-pro` automatically.
- Replace the placeholder `user-1` with your authenticated user ID when wiring auth.
